# Learn C With Me

C is a simple, yet beautiful programming language to learn, especially when you are just stepping into the world of programming. This blog is created with an idea of spreading my knowledge among the beginners (and the same time I am learning a lot too!).

By the way, I am a student studying Computer Science and Engineering (B.Tech) from NIT Durgapur, and I am in my second year only. If you have any queries or suggestions, or if you want to report any error, feel free to contact me at friendyankan@gmail.com. Thanks.
