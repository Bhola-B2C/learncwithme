title: Why C
meta: Understanding the need to learn C
description: We begin our journey with my very first tutorial which is just about why do we need to learn C. With so many programming languages around, we explore what is so special about C that it draws so much attention even after so many years of its birth and is it still worth learning C.

**What is C and why do we need to bother ourselves with it?** This is the first question that should come to your minds before we actually get into the subject. C is actually a general-purpose programming language designed in the 1970s with an objective of re-building the Unix operating system. It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time.  But many high-level lamguages have been developed since the birth of C. Those who know a little bit of programming would ask why learn C when he/she is already acquainted with high-end languages like Python, Ruby, Java, etc (only to name a few). In this post, I would like to answer that question and highlist a few facts about the programming language, that we like to call C.

I only came to know about the power of C after I began to learn it. As a matter of fact, C was developed so many years ago and still today it is extensively used in certain places which only goes on to show how powerful this language is! Following are few of the reasons why you might want to learn C:


<ol start="0" markdown="1">
  	<li>The very reason most of you are possibly reading this is because C is in the college curriculum, you need to learn it just to pass and you are dreaded of it. Just kidding (and that is why it is the 0th reason, duhh)! Well, though that may not be a proper reason but I promise you if that is the case with you in coming tutorials you will see C is really a fun language to learn.</li>

  	<li>For me this was the reason for learning C (I usually code in Python and I highly revere the language). What I think is important to learn as a programmer is how your program is being implemented in the memory. With C you can learn that easily. The language is so basic that you would be easily able to understand what is happening behind the scenes (or so to say!). So if you want to migrate to some so-called advanced languages, it is better to get some insight into the very basics of implementation of C and then do so.</li>

  	<li>Even today, C is faster than almost all the newer languages. Nothing beats the speed of execution of a program designed in C and hence its speed is efficiently used in many places. This is because C is very "<strong>close to the machine</strong>". What I mean by this is C is very basic in its implementation, there is nothing very special about the language and that is the reason why it is so fast. The newer languages have many advanced features like dynamic typing, garbage collection, etc for the programmer\'s convenience which costs a great deal of additional processing but C does not do any of that. Even the task of allocation and freeing of memory is left on the programmer (I guess you really have to be smart about that, ehh? Nah! These are some real advanced things, no need to worry about it just now).</li>

	<li>Finally, I can say that since almost all the languages borrow heavily from C, this will make things easier when you try to migrate to some other language from C. You can learn it better once you get comfortable with C.</li>
</ol>

You can skip over the following section if you are already bored, but if you are not, just bear with me and you will see some really interesting things written below. To show how much extensively C is used even these days, I will just outline the following applications of C (and there are many more):
  1. Most of the modern operating systems like Windows, UNIX, Linux are extensively written in C because of the excellent performance which can be obtained from C. Moreover, device driver programs used to make the OS compatible with new hardware devices are also written in C.
  2. Most of the \"smart\" devices are so smart because of C. Even the \"not-so-smart\" devices need C to work. What I mean is most devices like mobiles, tablets, microwave ovens, televisions, washing machines, radios all work on a microprocessor, the program for which has to work very fast and in very less memory. No wonder C saves the day once again!
  3. This one is for you, gamers! Many popular gaming frameworks (including DirectX, idTech (Doom) and many others) are written in C and one of its many children, C++.
  4. Many compilers and interpreters are written in C as well. Most interestingly the compiler of C is written in C itself! Actually the first compiler for C was written in assembly language and B programming language (C\'s predecessor). But then it evolved and GCC, a modern compiler of C is almost completely written in C (Ahh! That\'s so confusing. Darn it!)


Enough talking about why, let\'s get into learning how next. Wait for the next tutorial from which we\'ll start learning how to code in C and see many interesting things about C as we go along.
